# **React Blog App**

The app is a blog platform where users can create, read, update, and delete posts. It is built using **Typescript**, *a typed superset of **JavaScript** that provides type checking and other features to improve the development process and reduce bugs*.

**Axios** is used for making HTTP requests to the backend API. **Bootstrap** is used for styling the app and providing a responsive layout. **Formik** is used to handle form logic and validation, and **React Router DOM** is used for routing and navigating between different pages in the app.

## **Installation**
